# Oxygen-Flow-PID-Control

## Project Overview
This project presents the modeling and PID control of an oxygen flow
regulation subsystem used in medical oxygen concentrators.

## System Modeling
The oxygen flow control valve was modeled as a first-order dynamic system
based on typical response characteristics reported in biomedical device literature.

## Control Design
A PID controller was designed using MATLAB Control System Toolbox to ensure
fast response, minimal overshoot, and stable flow delivery.

## Applications
- Oxygen concentrators
- Ventilators
- Anesthesia machines
